# AirTech

Welcome to the AirTech project! This is a system for commercial aircraft maintenance, enhanced with an autonomous cart that can transport parts to the maintenance area, all controlled through cloud computing.

## Project Description

AirTech is a cutting-edge project developed by students of the **Analise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas (AMS)** course at ***Fatec Americana***, as part of the **Medio Tecnico e Superior articulation program**. The goal of AirTech is to revolutionize the way commercial aircraft maintenance is conducted by incorporating autonomous technology.

The system consists of a cloud-based platform that manages the maintenance process of commercial aircraft. It includes features such as maintenance scheduling, parts inventory management, and real-time monitoring of maintenance activities. Additionally, AirTech includes an autonomous cart that is capable of transporting parts from the inventory to the maintenance area, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing efficiency.

## Features

- Cloud-based platform: AirTech utilizes cloud computing to manage all aspects of the aircraft maintenance process. This allows for real-time monitoring and updates, as well as remote access to the system from any location with internet connectivity.

- Maintenance scheduling: The system allows for scheduling of maintenance activities based on predefined criteria, such as flight hours or calendar time. This ensures that maintenance tasks are conducted in a timely manner, minimizing aircraft downtime.

- Parts inventory management: AirTech keeps track of the inventory of aircraft parts, including their availability, location, and status. This allows maintenance personnel to easily locate and retrieve the necessary parts for repairs, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.

- Autonomous cart: AirTech includes an autonomous cart that can navigate through the maintenance facility and transport parts from the inventory to the maintenance area. The cart is equipped with sensors for obstacle detection and can operate autonomously, minimizing the need for human intervention.
